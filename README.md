synch digest and digest dictionary with remote repository. This has an application with shiny apps where objects are cached on a repository instead of a local machine, creating a passively increasing cache directory that multiple users can read and write to. This should increase app efficiency by only one user running new parameter permutations of a app.

For an example see the [storage subdir](https://github.com/yonicd/gdigest/tree/master/storage).
